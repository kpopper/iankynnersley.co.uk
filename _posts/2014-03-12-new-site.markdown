New phase, new site. Now that I'm freelance again but with a different emphasis, i thought it was time to make a new site. 

I expect that I will mostly be using it to try and explore how to define what I do, what I'm most interested in working on and plenty of writing on loosely connected subjects. 

To paraphrase the great John Peel, it will "build up slowly".
