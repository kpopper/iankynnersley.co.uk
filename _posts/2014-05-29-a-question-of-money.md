title: A question of money
---

What should a consulting CTO do when it comes to money? Often companies turn to you in their hour of need. This usually means they don't have a lot of money and are potentially keen to offer equity instead. 

Your role is to align the technology with the business and so its vital to prioritise things that have intrinsic business value (e.g. fixing a bug in the payment process that's stopping new users registering). 

Equity will always be a question of personal choice and circumstance. Technologists in the UK are distinctly more wary of equity deals which is probably to do with the high cost of living (especially in London) and the fact that there are really very few startup success stories that have led to equity holders making any real money. Cash up front is always more desirable than a remote possibility of unquantified future payouts that are largely out of your control.

Added to that, a startup company in need of rescuing is not necessarily a sound investment choice.

That said, a company, team and product that you believe in can be a great investment and taking equity can give you a much stronger emotional attachment. 

Overall, for me, a cash agreement makes most sense for a consulting CTO in the majority of circumstances. If you believe in a company enough to take equity over payment, perhaps its worth considering putting the consulting to one side for a while and taking on a longer term role there?
