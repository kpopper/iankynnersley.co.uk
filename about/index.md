title: About me
---

I have over 8 years of technical leadership experience building new products and services with startups, charities and enterprise organisations.

I help teams ship digital products and services that users and customers value.

I establish lean product discovery processes that ensure features with the highest impact are prioritised and I build and organise teams to get those features into the hands of users as quickly as possible.

I also work with business leaders to develop technology strategies and roadmaps to keep everyone in the loop.

I value happy, healthy, diverse and inclusive teams that work collaboratively and autonomously to solve problems and iterate quickly.

Here are some of the ways I can help organisations:

* Provide technical consultation and advice to early stage founders
* Unblock product or engineering teams that are struggling to get products out of the door
* Help re-shape teams and departments to facilitate better inter-disciplinary collaboration â€“ e.g. between design and development
* Plan for migrating infrastructure to a new cloud environment
* Help define an appropriate target architecture for a maturing product
* Perform a technical spike to investigate the potential for a new technology
* Advise on managing client projects alongside core product development
* Join in a CTO or Technical Lead role
