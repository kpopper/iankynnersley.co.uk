title: Freelance dilemma
---

Many of my clients are small startups and social enterprises. So far, I have worked with a couple of very different businesses who have had the same issue, one I am very likely to encounter again and again. They have a tiny amount of money to fix some bugs in a codebase that's in a bit of a state.

I recently found myself thinking that if I could work for free I could make a real difference to this small, startup business but while I'm charging for my time, I drain their limited resources very quickly and can only make tiny improvememts that barely move them forward.

Charging a day rate makes it very hard to really *own* a problem area and get it sorted. That said, so does working for free.

So what is the most important thing for that company when there's so much to do?

Should the best advice from a consulting CTO be to get everything in order, at a cost, before fixing anything? What if the live site is broken to the point of damaging the business?

What if the business fails while you're getting the product in order? What would be the point then?

-- some thoughts about how to quickly identify the state of the codebase. Is it documented? Are any of the team still around? If not, how do you find out where everything is?
-- are there any tests? How can you ascertain whether bug fixes will make things better or worse?
