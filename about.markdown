# About me

I'm a freelance technical strategist. That means I use my background in building internet / mobile things to help people with great ideas use the most appropriate technology in the right way to be successful.

I believe the "why?" is more important and harder to get right than the "how?", so I try and help clients focus on that. I work best with other people and love getting my head around the people, culture and challenges of a new subject or industry. 

Until recently, I was a Product Lead at [Sidekick Studios](http://www.sidekickstudios.net) where among other things I explored (and prototyped) the future of insurance, created a pilot mobile fundraising platform and conceived and built a collaboration service to help marginalised young people get the education they deserve. 

At the same time I was working with colleagues to develop internal processes, find and win new work, and build and manage cross-disciplinary teams capable of delivering client projects.

I'm now available for hire so if any of this sounds useful, get in touch!
