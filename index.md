# Hello, I'm Ian

I'm a Technology Lead.

In other words I love helping people use technology to make great things.

I work with startups and founders to help them build amazing product businesses one step at a time.

[You can read more about me here](/about)

## Work

I specialise in turning business ideas into beautiful products.

My experience encompasses technical, product and business which means I often play a different role on each project. It usually involves some combination of product management, technical leadership, team management and product strategy.

Some recent projects I've worked on:
* &raquo; [Technical strategy for Provenance](/case_studies/provenance)
* &raquo; [Product strategy for a new Healthcare Startup](/case_studies/healthcare-startup)
* &raquo; [Product Owner for Adaptive Lab and Barclaycard](/case_studies/barclaycard)
* &raquo; [Temporary CTO at Doing Something](/case_studies/doing_something)

## Writing

Occasional thoughts about startups and technology, usually intended for small tech business owners:
  
{% if site.posts.size > 0 %}
  {% for post in site.posts %}
* &raquo; [{{ post.title }}]({{ post.url }})
  {%- endfor %}
{% endif %}
