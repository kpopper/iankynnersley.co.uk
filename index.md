# Hello, I'm Ian

I'm a technical lead who helps organisations big and small use technology to make great things.

[You can read more about me here](/about)

## Work

I specialise in turning business ideas into beautiful products.

My experience encompasses technical, product and business which means I often play a different role on each project. It usually involves some combination of product management, technical leadership, team management and product strategy.

Some recent projects I've worked on:
* &raquo; [CTO at Provenance](/case_studies/provenance) (2014 - 2019)
* &raquo; [Product strategy at Raremark](/case_studies/raremark) (2015)
* &raquo; [Product Owner at Adaptive Lab](/case_studies/adaptive_lab) (2014 - 2015)
* &raquo; [Temporary CTO at Doing Something](/case_studies/doing_something) (2014)

## Writing

Occasional thoughts about startups and technology, usually intended for small tech business owners:
  
{% if site.posts.size > 0 %}
  {% for post in site.posts %}
* &raquo; [{{ post.title }}]({{ post.url }})
  {%- endfor %}
{% endif %}

...and some music ramblings that don't really fit here:
