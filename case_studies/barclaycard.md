title: Case study - Barclaycard
---

Product development studio [Adaptive Lab](http://www.adaptivelab.co.uk) needed a Product Owner for their project to re-invent the application process for Barclaycard's commercial credit card product. 

I worked with a varied team of developers, designers, business analysts, systems architects and subject matter experts from 3 different companies to invent and define a better, digital-by-default application process. 

My role was to understand the business needs, coordinate user research and testing, prioritise and manage the analysis and design of the proposed system and help the client become comfortable with digital and our agile approach.
