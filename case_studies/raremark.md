title: Case study - Product strategy at Raremark
---

[Raremark](https://raremark.com/) A London-based healthcare company needed a team to help them turn their startup idea into something tangible; to start to articulate and validate it with potential users and to help them get funding to develop the idea further.

I worked closely with a designer ([Simon I'Anson](http://www.simonianson.co.uk/)) and a user researcher ([Barbara Chicca](http://barbarachicca.com/)) to understand the founders' vision for the service and the user need, to speak to potential users about their lives and experiences and then to start to sketch out a community site and knowledge base that could offer real help to people in difficult circumstances.

Within 4 weeks we developed the idea and built a prototype that allowed us to dig deeper into how a piece of technology could help solve a series of complex real-world issues. It helped frame conversations with the founders and gauge user feedback in a series of testing sessions. 

2 weeks later we had an improved prototype ready for further testing and to help the founder pitch for further funding.
