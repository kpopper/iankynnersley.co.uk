title: Case study - Freelance CTO at Doing Something
---

Doing Something is a dating start-up that connects people who like doing the same kinds of things.

The site has existed for a little while but it was proving expensive to progress and always felt out of sync with the business and its exciting marketing efforts. 

The founder came to me with a tiny budget and a broken but critical new version of the site. I documented the technology so that new developers could work on it, worked with him to define and prioritise the work to maximise the budget and helped him to find and coordinate a team that could fix the site.

I then persuaded him to find a more permanent team that were able to take payment in equity.
