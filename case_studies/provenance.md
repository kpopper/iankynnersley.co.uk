title: Case study - Provenance
---

Provenance is an early stage startup hoping to radically alter the way people spend their money by allowing brands and makers to be totally open about their products. 

I got involved initially to help them figure out how the service could work for paying clients and partners and to work out the strategy for embedding the product information on other websites in useful ways.

The service revolves around telling stories and sharing data and we want that information to be available whenever people are making purchasing decisions and wherever makers and brands are interacting with their customers. 

It has gone through a few iterations of the site while learning what customers, brands, makers, retailers all want from the service. I'm getting involved again now to plan the next, more permanent version of the service built around an API and integrating seemlessly with social and eCommerce platforms. 

My role includes working with the founder to shape the product strategy, technical architecture, road-mapping, hiring and managing the technical team and product management (story writing, backlog management).
