title: Albums of 2014
---

As a man in my mid (to late) 30s, I still of music in 'albums'. I realise my time has come and gone but there are still loads of musicians releasing amazing albums every year so I'll keep listening to them.

## 1. Teleman - Breakfast
When was a pop record my favourite album of the year? Probably never. Saw these live a couple of years ago and enjoyed it but didn't think much of it. Heard Cristina on the radio a few times and was hooked. I never expected the album to live up to it but somehow its a delight all the way through. 

## 2. Wildbirds and Peacedrums - Rhythm
Drums. Voice. Occasional percussion. Stark, other-worldly and beautiful. Soulful and danceable. All these things at once. Glorious. 

## 3. Tiny Ruins - Brightly Painted One
Another combination of single on the radio + live show. What is this, 1995? "Me in the Museum, You in the Winter Garden" had stopped me in my tracks while cooking a couple of times with its instant, heart-breaking beauty. The album is more of a grower.

## 4. Pye Corner Audio / Notwaving - Intercepts
I love PCA even if nobody else does. This is even better than last year's proper Sleep Games record. I just love the sound he makes. Puts a big smile on my face. 

## 5. Hookworms - The Hum
I spent most of the year listening to Pearl Mystic, their album from 2013 and then only spotted they had a new one a couple of weeks ago. It's even better!  Radio Tokyo is sooo good! Hypnotic rhythms and melodic shouting. Bloody ace.

Also-rans: 
### Temples - Sun Structures
Found this through the Norman Records weekly email. Then suddenly they were everywhere. Sounds fresh and familiar at the same time. Sounds stolen from every psych rock band of the 60s but done with style.

### Morgan Delt - Morgan Delt
Another one I came across on the Normal Records mail-out. Which is basically how I find out about music these days. Psych-y and swirly. Melodic but slightly odd. Really great.

### Tape - Casino
Nice sounds. The sort of record I listen to while doing something else. But in a good way.

### Stewart Walker - Ivory Tower Broadcast
This fits in the same part of my brain as the Tape album although it probably sounds completely different. I enjoy listening to it but it doesn't stay with me for long afterwards.
