title: 10 most influential albums
---

My friend [Tom](https://twitter.com/sonofswiss) challenged me a while ago to list my top 10 most influential albums. Not favourites but albums that have been influential in my life. For me that probably means albums that have made me see music differently.

I then mentioned the idea to another friend, [Gareth](https://twitter.com/Gaz11) who probably gave me a lot of the albums in my list when we were in school and he recently published his, thereby shaming me into actually doing mine.

So here they are. I'll write a paragraph about each at some point.

1. Michael Jackson - Bad
2. Lemonheads - Its a Shame About Ray
3. Blur - Modern Life is Rubbish
4. Smashing Pumpkins - Siamese Dreams
5. Tindersticks - The First Tindersticks Album
6. Radiohead - The Bends
7. Mogwai - 10 Rapid
8. Charlie Parker - vol. 1 on Jazz Reactivation records
9. Bonnie "Prince" Billy - The Letting Go
10. Jeffrey Lewis - City and Eastern Songs
